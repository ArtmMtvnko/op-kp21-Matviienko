The sun was setting as Jane walked down the street. 
She had been walking for hours, her mind wandering. 
The sky was beautiful, oranges and pinks fading into blue. 
Jane found herself walking towards the park, drawn to the peacefulness it offered. 
She found a bench and sat down, savoring the fresh air. 
Jane forgot her worries and enjoyed the moment. 
It's the simplest things in life that bring us happiness. 
Jane headed home, feeling lighter than before.
